#### As the company I want ...
  * A luxurious and modern looking website to show that we cater towards our
  members without holding.

  * The site to feel less corporate and more fun in order to attract members
  that align with our business values and the community we're trying to create.

  * Customers to have an easy time navigating the website so they can find any
  of the information they are looking for quickly.

  * Customers to view our amenities so they can know what we offer and entice them to enroll for membership.
#### As a potential member ...
  * I'd like to be able to easily view pictures of the space, find the location,
  and view pricing. This will allow me to easier make a decision if the workspace
  is for me.

  * I'd like a events section to view upcoming events, so that I can easier make plans to attend.

  ##### Non-Tech
    * I'd like to see non-coding related pictures to show that the space is used for all kinds of projects.
